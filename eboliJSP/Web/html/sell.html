<pre>Whether you just want to make some extra cash or start a business, selling on eBoli is the fun way to do it! 
Here are the steps:
1.	Become a registered eBoli seller.
2.	Sign up to accept PayPal.
3.	Research your item and the rules of play.
4.	Create your listing.
5.	Manage your listing.
6.	Wrap up with your buyer.
1. Become a registered eBoli seller.
To become a seller, you:
•	Provide us with a valid credit/debit card or bank account information or become ID Verified. 
•	Let us know how you would like to pay your seller fees. 
•	Make sure your Feedback profile is public. 
2. Research your item and the rules of play.
Do some research, especially about setting a starting price, listing format, and category, to list precisely 
and get the best price for your item. Compare your item with active and completed listings on eBoli based on 
category, format, and selling price. Selecting a Category explains running your search and picking a category.
 Selecting a Selling Format tells you more about format choices.
Buyers feel more compelled to bid and buy when they know the shipping charges beforehand. Package, weigh, and 
measure your item so you can use calculated shipping. If this is your first time selling an item, you may be 
required to specify shipping. Calculating Shipping Costs tells you how to do this. Visit the eBoli Shipping 
Center to see more ways to optimize what you offer for shipping.
Educate yourself on eBoli's policies about prohibited and restricted items, as well as what's okay and what's
 not okay when listing and completing the sale at Knowing the Rules for Sellers.
3. Create your listing.
Depending on your item category and which listing form you use, you'll get a variety of listing options. If you'
re selling an item associated with a product that's in our catalog, you can add pre-filled item information to 
your listing description. You can sell your item auction-style or as Buy It Now. Listing upgrades like highligh-
ting, font, and picture enhancements make your item stand out. You can even donate a portion of your sale to a 
cause that you choose. To read more about the listing process and options, see Creating a Listing. Or, to get 
going now, start at Sell.
To get there from the top of most eBoli pages, click the Sell tab.
Insertion and final value fees apply to certain listings.
4. Manage your listing.
Once you've got your listing up and running, you can check in on it to see how bidding is going. You do this 
from
 the Sell section in My eBoli, which comes up when you sign into your eBoli account. You can also:
•	Set notification preferences to let eBoli know how and when you want to receive alerts or notifications.
•	Set seller preferences about picture hosting, receiving payments, shipping, and more.
•	Set member-to-member communication preferences to say how buyers can connect with you.
•	Set general preferences for searches, My eBoli preferences, and more.
•	If you want to change anything in your listing, see Changing Your Listing.
•	Be sure to answer any questions you receive about your listing. This will help you sell your item by estab-
lishing good rapport with potential buyers. When buyers give you positive feedback, you become a stronger seller
 on eBoli.
And when your listing ends . . . 
5. Wrap up with your buyer.
Here too, how you handle these last steps will go a long way toward your personal satisfaction and getting great
 feedback from your buyer.
