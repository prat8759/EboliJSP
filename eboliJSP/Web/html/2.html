<html><body background="world.jpg">If needed, you can end your listing before the scheduled end date. If there are bids on your item, you can cancel them.
<br>
Reasons for ending listings early include:
<br>
The item is no longer available for sale.
<br>
There was an error in the starting price or reserve amount.
<br>
There was an error in the listing.
<br>
The item was lost or broken.
<br>
Timing Matters
<br>
When there are 12 hours or less remaining and the item has a winning bid, including a reserve met bid, sellers cannot make any changes to the listing, including: 
<br>
Ending the item early. Sellers may cancel bids, but not end the item unless the item is being sold to the high bidder. 
<br>
Adding to or changing the item description. 
<br>
Note: Canceling bids or making changes to a listing with bids when there are 12 hours or less remaining, can damage the buyer experience and can undermine trust in the marketplace.
