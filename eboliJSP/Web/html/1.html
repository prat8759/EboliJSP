If you receive an email that appears to be from eboli that requests sensitive personal information, be cautious. The email may be a "spoof" or "phishing" email. The people who send these fake emails hope that unsuspecting recipients will reply or click on a link contained in the email and then provide sensitive personal information including passwords, social security numbers or credit card numbers.<br><br><br>

Legitimate eboli emails 
<br>
eboli will never ask you to provide account numbers, passwords or other sensitive information through email. If eboli does request information from you, a copy of that email will be in the My Messages box in My eboli. If you have any doubt that an email really is from eboli, open a new browser window, type www.ebay.com, and sign in. Any email that looks as if it is from eboli, mentions a problem with your account or requests personal information, and is not in My Messages in My eboli, is a spoof (fake) email.

Spoof emails<br>

Spoof emails often include the use of the eboli logo and an eboli address in the "From" line (for example, "From: support@eboli.com") The email may mimic common eboli emails, such as notifications of problems with your account, “Ask seller a question” emails or offers to become an eboli PowerSeller. 
<br><br><br>
Spoof emails typically have the following characteristics.
<br>
Requests sensitive information. (Example: Please update your credit card number.) 
<br>
Starts with a generic greeting. (Example: Dear eboli member) 
<br>
Has an urgent tone for quick action. (Example: “Ignoring this message will result in a suspension of your account within 24 hours”.) 
<br>
Contains links to Web pages that resemble the eboli sign-in page. (Example spoof Web link: http://signin-eboli.com/) 
<br>
When you receive a suspicious email
<br>
Do not click on any link in the email. The purpose of spoof email is to lead you to a Web site and attempt to collect personal information and commit identity theft or other crimes. 
<br>
Report the email by forwarding it to spoof@eboli.com. eboli will review the email and let you know if it was legitimately sent by eboli. 
<br>
Important: In order for eboli to investigate your report, you must forward the email without adding attachments, adding text or altering text.
